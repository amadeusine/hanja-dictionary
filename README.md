Hanja Dictionary

This package contains the radical chart from the kanjidic project ('radkfile.utf8'). More information about this project is available at http://www.csse.monash.edu.au/~jwb/kanjidic.html.

The related Korean vocabulary words are a subset of the information from the engdic Korean-English dictionary project, which was originally compiled by KwangSuk Lee. More information is available at http://www.kecl.ntt.co.jp/icl/mtg/resources/engdic/. Engdic is realeased under the GPL.

The hanja input file from the nabi project ('nabi.txt') was used for the basis of the Korean definitions of the hanja. English definitions were added from the Ubihan.txt file available at ftp://ftp.unicode.org/Public/UNIDATA/Unihan.zip. Nabi is released under the GPL. More information is available from http://nabi.kldp.net/.

Further entries were added from the 6,000 most frequently used words guide created by the National Institute of Korean language in Korea.
